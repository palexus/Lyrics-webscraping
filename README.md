# Text Classification

This project was made to learn the basics of webscraping and text classification. It scrapes the lyrics of your favorite bands (lyrics.com) and then you can type in a text and it will tell you to which band it probably belongs.

# How to use it?

Clone this project and create a new environement, e.g.

  conda create -n webscraping -c conda-forge scikit-learn
